Godot is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS, IOS, WebGL, ect.) 2D and 3D
game engine written in primarly c++ that uses a node based system organised as
trees in scenes. Godot supports a variety of programming languages that can be
used to program a game including GDScript, C++, and C# offcially supported with
many others by the community. Godot only currently supports rendering with
OpenGL ES 2 and 3 with Vulkan support comming in Godot 4
([1])[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)] I will be using
GDScript because I am the most familiar with that.

Godot has been used by many people to make many games with notables ones being: 

- Carol Reed Mysteries
- City Game Studio
- Cruelty Squad
- Hardcoded
- Kingdoms of the Dump
- Rogue State Revolution
- Sonic Colors: Ultimate

I have never played any of them (I don't really play any games) but they all
seem to have mostly positive reviews, played by lots of people, and looks good
so they must be good.
