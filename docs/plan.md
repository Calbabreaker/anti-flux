# Planning

## Brainstorm

-   Platformer game where gravity switches
    -   Using keybind
    -   Randomly
    -   Jump
-   Factory game
    -   Puzzle game make shapes
    -   **_Timestep based to make things meeting quota_**
        -   Buildings interact with each other
            -   Place them in a limited area
-   Clicker game
    -   Limited clicks so plan
    -   Place buildings
-   Rules change
    -   Randomly
    -   Interactable
-   Tower defence game
    -   Send enemies to destroy the defence
    -   Enemies can attack towers

## Final Idea

You build a factory from buildings that you pick that synergizes with each
other to make enough antimatter to pay for the factory.

#### Objective

Place buildings that you can pick from (limited choice) every timestep that can
synergize with each other. Use those buildings to make enough antimatter to pay for
the factory on every stage that happens every few timesteps and increases
exponentially (the price) every stage. Because the price increases
exponentially, you have to utilize syngergy to exponentially increase your
production.

#### Winning condition

Pass through all the stages without being unable to pay for the factory.

#### Theme

-   2D top down fixed camera or moveable camera but limited area.
-   Quite dark with futuristic looking buildings.

#### Steps

1. Make a grid based placing system
2. Make the antimatter currency system
3. Make buildings generage antimatter
4. Make the payment system for every stage
5. Make buildings that synergize
6. Polish
