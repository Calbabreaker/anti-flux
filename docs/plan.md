# Planning

## Brainstorm

- Platformer game where gravity switches 
    - Using keybind
    - Randomly
    - Jump
- Factory game 
    - Puzzle game make shapes
    - ***Timestep based to make things meeting quota***
        - Buildings interact with each other
            - Place them in a limited area
- Clicker game
    - Limited clicks so plan
    - Place buildings 
- Rules change
    - Randomly
    - Interactable
- Tower defence game
    - Send enemies to destroy the defence
    - Enemies can attack towers

## Final Idea

You build a factory from buildings that you pick that synergizes with each
other to make enough antimatter to pay for the factory.

### Objective

Place buildings that you can pick from (limited choice) every timestep that can
synergize with each other. Use those buildings to make enough items to pay for
the factory on every stage that happens every few timesteps and increases (the
price) every stage.

### Winning condition

Pass through all the stages without being unable to pay for the factory.
